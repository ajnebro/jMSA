EXAMPLE 1
In order to prove that the program works correctly, we have aligned a fasta and calculated
all the scores.

The file consists of 5 protein sequences from 5 different organisms: Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus (rooster), Equus caballus (horse),
Papio anubis (primate) and Loxodonta africana (elephant). Those sequences, express a hemoglobin subunit, which can be alpha,
beta, gamma or delta.

Hemoglobin is a protein present in the red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the
organs and tissues of the body. In addition, it transports carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions back to the lungs.

As we have observed in the results of applying the scores,

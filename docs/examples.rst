To carry out this example, we have chosen the protein Aurora kinase B. It is a protein whose main molecular function is related to cellular mitosis and meiosis. To perform the alignment we have taken the sequence of the organisms Homo sapiens (Human), Mus musculus (Mouse), Rattus norvegicus (Rat), Sus scrofa (Pig), Bos taurus (Bovine) and Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog).

In all of them the Aurora Kinase B protein is involved in the cell division process, specifically in the action carried out by the microtubules. These are in charge of aligning the chromosomes in the center of the dividing cell, so that after a depolarization the separation of the two chromatids on each chromosome is achieved. What is considered one of the fundamental steps during cell division.

Our protein aurora kinase B is found in microtubules close to kinetochores, specifically in those specialized called K fibers.

Its importance of study resides in the fact that the overexpression of this protein causes an uneven distribution of the genetic content, generating aneuploid cells, a distinctive mark of cancer.

On the other hand, another of its molecular functionalities is the union of metal ions, which is also worth mentioning because a failure in the proteins that have this molecular function can trigger the accumulation of metals at harmful levels in the organism.

Finally, it was also studied that the axotomy of some cultured neurons showed a clear positive regulation in the expression of the gene of our protein, coinciding with an axonal regenerative outbreak. Furthermore, overexpression of Aurora B kinase has been shown to produce accelerated axonal growth in spinal motor neurons during zebrafish growth.

For all these curiosities and the number of organisms that contain it, we have decided to take this protein as an example.

The alignment shown has been done with 'Clustalw', a tool for biological sequence alignments. Finally, let's pass this alignment to the 'Examples2' class and run it.We get the following information:

We can observe that the entropy is 2.07. Regarding the percentage of non-gaps and the percentage of conserved columns, they are 96.07% and 60.38%, respectively. The score obtained applying the star method in the PAM250 substitution matrix is 9303, while applied to Blosum62 it is 9512. Finally, we see that the sum of pairs of PAM250 is 21319 and of Blosum62 is 21618.

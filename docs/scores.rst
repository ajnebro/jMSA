Entropy
-------

Entropy can be related to physics' magnitude that allows us to measure the non-usable part of the energy
contained in a system of particles or data. That means that that part of the total can not be used to produce
physical work. It also measures how diverse are the residues in a column. It can also be understood as a way
of measuring the disorder in a specific point of the matter. Entropy is important because it tells us that systems
can't go back in their processes and how is the energy wasted in a closed environment. Mathematically it's
represented by the summatory of residue's frequency times the logarithm of different residue's number.
